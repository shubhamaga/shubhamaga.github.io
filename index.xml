      <description>Can smartphones replace professional cameras?
That question has stirred up one of the more prevalent and polarizing discussions in the phone industry the past few years. And it’s certainly understandable. After all, smartphones did put point-and-shoot cameras out of existence.

      <description>New Beginnings This is the first post. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve come across these before.
But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it&amp;rsquo;s simply a placeholder. On the contrary, I take first posts rather seriously.
For me, this piece is a harbinger to the forthcoming good stuff. The question is what will I publish here?
Honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a specific answer. Most likely, this personal blog will be home to everything that comes to my mind which I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to pitch to other publications.</description>

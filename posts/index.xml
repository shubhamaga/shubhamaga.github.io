			<description>New Beginnings This is the first post. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve come across these before.
But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it&amp;rsquo;s simply a placeholder. On the contrary, I take first posts rather seriously.
For me, this piece is a harbinger to the forthcoming good stuff. The question is what will I publish here?
Honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a specific answer. Most likely, this personal blog will be home to everything that comes to my mind which I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to pitch to other publications.</description>

<h1 id="new-beginnings">New Beginnings</h1>

<p>This is the first post. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve come across these before.</p>

<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s simply a placeholder. On the contrary, I take first posts rather seriously.</p>

<p>For me, this piece is a harbinger to the forthcoming good stuff. The question is what will I publish here?</p>

<p>Honestly, I don&rsquo;t have a specific answer. Most likely, this personal blog will be home to everything that comes to my mind which I won&rsquo;t be able to pitch to other publications. Be it pop-culture discussions, fiction stories I occasionally pen down, bigger philosophical thoughts, travel stories, extensions to my Twitter rants, the works.</p>

<p>It won&rsquo;t be that often, however. I will try to post at least a few times every month.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s get started.</p>
